      <p>I've always been super into reading, this year i'm trying to expand my taste
      <br>and dabble into topics i've never tried before.</p>

      <p>namely, i want to read up more about history, political idealogies and philosophy</p>

      <p>currently i'm reading "The Brothers Karamazov" (book review coming soon!!) by Fyodor Dostoevsky
      <br>and "foresight", in which the author argues against Darwin's "Theory of Evolution".</p>
