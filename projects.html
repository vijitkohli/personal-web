      <p>In an attempt to try something new, I made a remake of Suika Game (Watermelon Game) 
      <br>in collaboration with a friend.</p>
      <p>Since this is an almost exact copy of the actual game, I can't publish it online
      <br>so here's a GIF of me playing it in Unity.</p>
      <p>I also started a machine learning project, which is a web-based movie recommender system.
      <br>Apart from the recommendation system, 
      <br>there's an AI chatbot that you can go to, to get recommendations based on your mood.</p>
      <p>The actual recommendation and chatbot part is still incomplete, but here's a screenshot of the web page.</p>
